This repository is a program that I wrote to parse Chinese texts and extract
word appearances. It is helpfuli for when I am reading a Chinese text that may
have words I am unfamiliar with. 
The output is a csv file that lists the word, frequency,
pronunciation, and the meaning. For example,
if you are reading a book, you can run the program on 1 chapter at a time, and learn all the 
vocabulary for that chapter. After that, you can read the chapter without having
to stop every time you encounter a new word.

Requirements:
	Python 3
	
Setup:
	1. Put all the files in a folder somewhere
	2. Put the text you want to analyze in the file called article.txt
	3. Run parse.py
	4. Open stats.csv in whatever program you want (excel, notepad++, etc...)
